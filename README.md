# Problem Statement
Whenever we book for accommodations in any tourist app like MakeMyTrip we get the name of the hotels/resorts which satisfies our needs. Needs like (price, number of rooms, and a textual information about the location of the hotels). But we don't get the satellite view of the accommodations, which will help us to understand more accurately their locations and thus make best choice.

# Solution
By this application I wanted to tackle this problem, by making use of 
1. Google Places API to search for the place we want to visit.
2. Google Maps to display all the available accommodations in that place.
3. Login functionality to authorize the User using firebase
